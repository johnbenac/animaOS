# ANIMA OS - Roadmap

## Guiding Principle

Build depth before breadth. Every phase should make ANIMA feel more like a
being who knows you, not a tool that merely does more things.

## Foundation: The Core

Goal: keep ANIMA local-first and portable while tightening encryption and memory
continuity over time.

Current implementation baseline:

- the server defaults to a local SQLite Core in `.anima/dev/anima.db`
- `manifest.json` is created in the Core directory at startup
- structured memory now lives in SQLite tables, not markdown files
- `soul.md` has been migrated into the database (`self_model_blocks` table with section="soul"); legacy files are auto-migrated on first read
- SQLCipher support exists behind `ANIMA_CORE_PASSPHRASE`, but encryption is not yet enforced by default
- vault export/import is encrypted and includes full database state
- embeddings persist in SQLite and the runtime keeps a process-local vector index

Target principle: if you can copy the Core directory to another machine and
unlock it safely, the feature is aligned with the product.

## Phase 0: Prompt Memory Blocks

Status: complete

Delivered:

- facts, preferences, goals, relationships, and focus flow back into prompts
- thread summaries and recent episodes are injected into runtime context
- session notes provide per-thread working memory
- soul directive injected as highest-priority memory block

## Phase 1: Finish Encrypted Core Rollout

Status: mostly complete

What is already true:

- the database can be encrypted with SQLCipher when `ANIMA_CORE_PASSPHRASE` is configured
- vault export/import is encrypted
- `soul.md` migrated into the database (no longer file-backed, and covered when the Core is encrypted)
- vault export decrypts field-level encryption before packaging (plaintext inside vault envelope)
- vault import re-encrypts fields with the importing user's DEK (portable across machines)
- vault envelope uses AAD context binding (`anima-vault:v{version}:{scope}`)
- manifest.json (core_id, created_at) is preserved across vault transfers
- memories-only vault import no longer destroys conversation tables

What still needs to happen:

- make encrypted Core startup behavior explicit and fail fast when the expected encryption path is unavailable
- make encryption the default state (not opt-in via env var)
- derive SQLCipher key via Argon2id (HKDF from Master KEK), not raw passphrase — eliminates weaker PBKDF2 path
- set explicit SQLCipher PRAGMAs: `cipher_page_size = 4096`, `cipher_memory_security = ON`
- wire AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) into all field-level encryption calls — infrastructure exists but is dormant
- seal the filesystem boundary: audit and eliminate all plaintext files outside the encrypted database
- unify or document the dual-secret model (env var passphrase for SQLCipher vs login password for KEK/DEK)

## Phase 1.5: Cryptographic Hardening

Status: planned

Goals:

- per-domain DEKs: replace single DEK with domain-specific keys (conversations, memories, emotions, self-model, identity)
- core identity keypair: Ed25519 keypair generated at Core creation, private key encrypted with DEK_identity, public key in manifest
- core integrity attestation: Merkle root over critical tables, signed at lock time, verified at unlock
- vault hardening: zstd compression before encryption, Ed25519 signature over vault envelope, sequence numbers for rollback detection
- Argon2id parameter tuning: time_cost=4, parallelism=4 to meet 2-second wall-clock target

Deliverable: a Core with compartmentalized encryption, a cryptographic identity, tamper detection, and hardened vault format.

## Phase 2: Background LLM Memory Extraction

Status: complete

Delivered:

- regex extraction remains the fast path
- background LLM extraction runs when a real provider is configured
- extracted items are written into `memory_items`
- emotion detection runs alongside memory extraction in the same LLM call

## Phase 3: Conflict Resolution

Status: complete

Delivered:

- similar memories trigger an `UPDATE` vs `DIFFERENT` check
- superseded memories are preserved for auditability but excluded from active retrieval

## Phase 4: Episodic Memory

Status: complete

Delivered:

- episodes are generated from conversation history
- episodes are stored in `memory_episodes`
- recent episodes are injected into prompts

## Phase 5: Retrieval Scoring and Context Selection

Status: complete

Delivered:

- retrieval uses importance, recency, and access frequency
- active prompt memory is selected rather than dumped wholesale

## Phase 6: Reflection and Sleep Tasks

Status: complete

Delivered:

- inactivity-triggered reflection with quick inner monologue
- contradiction scanning and resolution
- profile synthesis
- episode generation
- embedding backfill
- deep monologue (full self-model reflection) runs during sleep tasks
- working memory expiry sweep removes date-tagged items automatically
- feedback signal collection (re-asks, corrections) feeds into growth log

Future enhancement: adopting the async post-turn execution pattern from Letta's `SleeptimeMultiAgentV4` — see Phase 10.6 for the full plan.

## Phase 7: Proactive Companion

Status: complete

Delivered:

- daily brief on app launch (`GET /api/chat/brief`)
- LLM-generated personalized greetings using self-model and emotional context (`GET /api/chat/greeting`)
- quiet nudges for overdue tasks (`GET /api/chat/nudges`)
- home dashboard with task count, journal streak, memory count (`GET /api/chat/home`)
- manual triggers for sleep tasks, consolidation, and deep reflection

## Phase 8: Ambient Presence

Status: future

Goals:

- system tray or menu bar mode
- compact companion surface
- global summon or quick-open flows

## Phase 8.5: Privacy-Preserving Inference

Status: future

Goals:

- context sanitization pipeline: name pseudonymization, date generalization, sensitivity-based memory filtering before remote inference
- TEE-aware provider selection: detect and prefer TEE-enabled inference endpoints (Intel TDX, NVIDIA H100 CC)
- attestation verification for TEE providers
- privacy indicator in UI showing local vs remote vs TEE-protected inference

Deliverable: reduced exposure of personal data during remote inference, with clear user visibility into privacy posture.

## Phase 9: Stronger Semantic Retrieval

Status: complete

Delivered:

- embeddings generated for memories via the server's embedding-compatible providers (`ollama`, `openrouter`, `vllm`)
- query-aware semantic retrieval: user messages are embedded and matched against stored memory embeddings at conversation time
- semantically relevant memories injected as a dedicated memory block in the system prompt
- process-local vector index rebuildable from SQLite-backed embeddings
- brute-force fallback when vector index is empty

## Phase 9.5: Relational Memory (Knowledge Graph)

Status: planned

Goals:

- lightweight knowledge graph layer capturing entity-relationship structure alongside vector search
- entity extraction during consolidation pipeline (people, places, projects, organizations)
- typed relationships (works-at, married-to, friend-of, related-to-project)
- graph-augmented retrieval: vector similarity + graph traversal for structurally connected memories
- world model section in user memory: key people, places, recurring situations, active projects

Rationale: Mem0g demonstrated 26% accuracy improvement with graph-augmented vector search. Flat vector similarity loses relational structure that matters for understanding the user's life as an interconnected whole. The knowledge graph does not replace vector search — it augments it.

Implementation pattern (from Mem0 source analysis): Mem0's `MemoryGraph` extracts entities via structured LLM tool calls (`EXTRACT_ENTITIES_TOOL` with name/type/description schema), then extracts relations between them. Entity deduplication uses a second LLM pass to detect aliases (e.g., "NYC" = "New York City"). AnimaOS should implement this as two SQLite tables (`entities`, `entity_relations`) within the existing encrypted Core, extracted during the consolidation pipeline alongside existing regex + LLM fact extraction.

Deliverable: entity-relationship graph stored in SQLite, extracted during consolidation, queried alongside vector search at retrieval time.

## Phase 9.7: Hybrid Search (BM25 + Vector + RRF)

Status: planned

Goals:

- add BM25 lexical search index alongside existing in-memory vector index
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine vector and BM25 results (k=60)
- parallel search execution: vector and BM25 searches run concurrently via thread pool

Rationale: Pure vector similarity misses keyword-relevant memories that embedding models under-represent. Nemori's `UnifiedSearchEngine` demonstrated that BM25 + vector + RRF fusion catches memories that either search alone would miss. MemoryOS's session search combines semantic similarity with keyword Jaccard similarity for a similar effect.

Implementation pattern (from Nemori source analysis): Nemori maintains parallel BM25 and ChromaDB indices with `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)`, fetches 2x `top_k` candidates from each, then applies RRF: `score(item) = sum(1/(k + rank + 1))` across both result sets. AnimaOS can implement BM25 in-process (using `rank_bm25` library against SQLite-stored memory text) alongside the existing vector index, with RRF fusion in the retrieval scoring layer.

Deliverable: hybrid search returning higher-recall, higher-precision memory retrieval without additional infrastructure.

## Phase 10: Deep Self-Model and Consciousness

Status: complete

Delivered:

- five-section self-model per user: identity, inner_state, working_memory, growth_log, intentions
- self-model seeds automatically on first interaction with sparse, first-meeting content
- identity section evolves through deep monologue and flows into the system prompt as dynamic persona
- emotional intelligence: 12-emotion taxonomy, confidence thresholds, trajectory tracking, rolling signal buffer
- intentional agency: structured goals with lifecycle (detected, active, completed), procedural rules derived from experience
- inner monologue: quick reflection (post-conversation) and deep monologue (sleep-time) update all self-model sections
- deep monologue episode sampling: combined strategy — (1) stratified temporal sampling across time periods to prevent recency bias, (2) importance-weighted random sampling so high-significance old episodes are as likely as moderate recent ones, (3) significance-floor inclusion so episodes above 0.8 significance are always eligible regardless of age. See inner-life.md Section 13.6 for CLS justification.
- consciousness REST API: view and edit self-model sections, emotional state, intentions
- user edits treated as highest-confidence evidence, logged in growth log
- full vault export/import support for consciousness tables

## Phase 10.3: Predict-Calibrate Consolidation

Status: planned

Goals:

- prediction-correction learning cycle during memory consolidation (based on Free Energy Principle)
- before extracting facts from a conversation, predict expected content from existing knowledge
- extract only the delta: surprises, contradictions, and genuinely new information
- knowledge quality gates: persistence test, specificity test, utility test, independence test
- cold-start mode for first interactions when no prior knowledge exists

Rationale: Nemori's `PredictionCorrectionEngine` demonstrated that predict-then-extract produces higher-quality semantic memories than direct extraction alone. By predicting what you'd expect, you focus extraction on surprises — the information with highest learning value. This mirrors the neuroscience Free Energy Principle: learning = prediction error minimization.

Implementation pattern (from Nemori source analysis): Two-step process: (1) retrieve relevant existing semantic memories via vector search, generate LLM prediction of episode content; (2) compare prediction with actual conversation, extract only statements that represent new knowledge. Quality filter applies 4 tests: Will this still be true in 6 months? Does it contain concrete, searchable information? Can it help predict future needs? Can it be understood without conversation context? AnimaOS's existing `consolidation.py` LLM extraction can be wrapped with this predict-calibrate layer.

Deliverable: higher-quality fact extraction that avoids redundant storage and focuses on genuinely novel information.

## Phase 10.4: Heat-Based Memory Scoring

Status: planned

Goals:

- heat score for memory items: `H = alpha * access_count + beta * interaction_depth + gamma * recency_decay`
- heat-triggered consolidation: expensive operations (profile extraction, deep reflection) run only when accumulated heat exceeds threshold
- heat-triggered promotion: memories with sustained heat graduate from episodic to semantic to self-model level
- replace fixed-timer reflection triggers with heat-threshold triggers for more efficient resource use

Rationale: MemoryOS's heat-based session management demonstrated that importance-weighted memory management outperforms both fixed-timer and simple-recency approaches. Sessions with high visit frequency, deep interactions, and recent access accumulate "heat" that triggers analysis. This is more efficient than running consolidation on a fixed schedule.

Implementation pattern (from MemoryOS source analysis): `compute_segment_heat(session)` = `alpha * N_visit + beta * L_interaction + gamma * R_recency` where `R_recency = compute_time_decay(last_visit, now, tau_hours=24)`. Sessions stored in a max-heap (negated min-heap). When top session's heat exceeds threshold, profile + knowledge extraction runs in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)`. After analysis, heat resets. AnimaOS can apply this to memory items: each access bumps heat, consolidation fires when hottest memory cluster exceeds threshold.

Deliverable: efficient resource allocation for memory consolidation based on actual memory activity rather than wall-clock time.

## Phase 10.5: Intentional Forgetting

Status: planned — [PRD: F7](../prds/F7-intentional-forgetting.md)

Goals:

- passive decay: heat-based visibility floor excludes sub-threshold memories from retrieval (integrates with Phase 10.4)
- active suppression: explicitly corrected/superseded memories decay 3x faster and have derived references flagged for regeneration
- user-initiated forgetting: cryptographic deletion of specific memories with embedding removal and derived-reference cleanup
- topic-scoped forgetting: forget all memories matching a topic or entity (e.g., "forget everything about Alex")
- forget audit log: records that forgetting occurred (scope, counts) without recording what was forgotten
- derived reference cleanup: flagging growth log entries, episodes, and behavioral rules that cite forgotten memories for regeneration during sleep tasks

Deliverable: forgetting as a first-class memory operation, not just archival.

## Phase 10.6: Async Sleep-Time Agents

Status: planned

Goals:

- replace inactivity-triggered synchronous sleep tasks with asynchronous post-turn execution
- frequency gating: configurable `sleeptime_agent_frequency` prevents expensive background work on every turn
- last-processed-message tracking: `BackgroundTaskRun` table stores the last conversation message processed, preventing reprocessing
- per-user async queues: `asyncio.create_task()` replaces blocking calls, allowing the foreground response to return immediately
- heat-gated dispatch: background consolidation only fires when heat threshold is exceeded (integrates with Phase 10.4)

Rationale: Current AnimaOS sleep tasks run on inactivity timers, meaning consolidation only happens when the user stops talking. Letta's `SleeptimeMultiAgentV4` demonstrated that post-turn async execution with frequency gating produces more timely and efficient background processing. The user's response is not blocked; consolidation runs in the background while the conversation continues.

Implementation pattern (from Letta source analysis): `SleeptimeMultiAgentV4.step()` calls `asyncio.create_task(run_sleeptime_agents())` after each foreground step. `run_sleeptime_agents()` uses a per-agent `_sleeptime_agent_frequency` counter and only runs if `turn_count % frequency == 0`. A `last_processed_message_id` field prevents reprocessing the same conversation turn on restart. AnimaOS implements this via a new `BackgroundTaskRun` SQLAlchemy model and a `schedule_background_memory_consolidation()` orchestrator that replaces the current inactivity-based trigger.

Deliverable: background consolidation that runs continuously after turns, not just on inactivity, with configurable frequency gating and restart safety.

## Phase 10.7: Batch Episode Segmentation

Status: planned

Goals:

- replace fixed-size episode chunking (every N turns) with LLM-driven topic-coherent segmentation
- single LLM call groups a buffer of messages into non-contiguous topic episodes (e.g., `[[1,2,3], [8,10,11], [4,5,6,7,9,12]]`)
- non-continuous grouping: messages belonging to different topics can be interleaved, and the segmenter assigns each to the correct episode
- low-temperature generation (0.2) for deterministic groupings
- fallback to sequential method if LLM segmentation fails

Rationale: Current AnimaOS episodes are created by counting turns (every 6 turns = one episode). This misses topic boundaries — a conversation may switch subjects mid-episode or sustain a single topic across many turns. Nemori's `BatchSegmenter` demonstrated that LLM-driven segmentation produces topic-coherent episodes that better represent the semantic structure of a conversation, improving retrieval precision for episodic memory.

Implementation pattern (from Nemori source analysis): Nemori's `BatchSegmenter.segment()` sends a buffer of messages (with 1-based indices) to the LLM and receives back a list of index groups. Non-continuous indices are valid — `[1,2,3]` and `[8,10,11]` can both appear as separate episodes even though messages 4-7 and 9 appear in a third group. AnimaOS implements this as a new `batch_segmenter.py` module modifying `maybe_generate_episode()` in `episodes.py`, triggered when the message buffer exceeds 8 turns. A new `segmentation_method` column on the episode table tracks whether sequential or batch-LLM segmentation was used.

Deliverable: topic-coherent episodes that reflect actual conversation structure rather than fixed turn counts, improving episodic memory retrieval quality.

## Phase 11: Embodied Extensions

Status: future

Goals:

- voice-first surfaces
- device and ambient extensions
- mobile, wearable, or robotic shells sharing the same Core
- multi-modal memory: voice-derived emotional signals (tone, pace, volume, hesitation) feeding into emotional intelligence
- temporal context capture: time of day, day of week, interaction duration as implicit emotional signal
- ambient context (opt-in): location, activity, environmental state enriching episode capture

## Phase 12: Succession and Guardianship

Status: future

Goals:

- Shamir's Secret Sharing for multi-guardian succession (M-of-N threshold to recover Core access)
- inheritance chains: successive ownership transfers with cryptographic handoff
- cryptographic succession scopes via domain DEKs — key-selection instead of data-deletion allows granting access to specific memory domains

Deliverable: a Core that can survive its owner through controlled, cryptographically scoped succession.

## Implementation Constraints

These remain the product bar even where the current code has not fully reached it:

1. No cloud data storage for personal memory.
2. Portable-by-default local state.
3. Encryption should become the default for user-private data at rest.
4. The Core remains fundamentally single-user.
