# PRD: F4 — Knowledge Graph (SQLite-backed)

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-03-18
**Status**: Draft
**Roadmap Phase**: 9.5
**Priority**: P1
**Depends on**: None (independent); benefits from F1 for entity-name BM25 matching
**Blocks**: F5 (graph ingestion is one of the parallel background tasks)

---

## 1. Overview

Add a lightweight knowledge graph layer on top of existing semantic memory. Entities (people, places, organizations, concepts) and typed relationships between them are extracted from conversations and stored in two new SQLite tables. This gives AnimaOS relational structure between its flat facts — enabling graph traversal for context that embedding similarity alone would miss.

When the user asks "what do you know about my family?", AnimaOS can traverse the graph from the user entity through `sister_of`, `parent_of`, `married_to` relations and surface connected memories, rather than relying on embedding similarity between "family" and individual fact strings.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State

AnimaOS stores flat semantic facts in `MemoryItem`:

```
"User works at Google" (category: fact)
"Alice is User's sister" (category: relationship)
"User lives in Berlin" (category: fact)
"Alice's birthday is March 15" (category: fact)
"User is working on Project Aurora at Google" (category: fact)
```

These are independent strings with no relational structure. There is no way to:

- **Link entities**: "Alice" in fact #2 and "Alice" in fact #4 are not connected
- **Traverse relationships**: "Who does the user know?" requires scanning all facts for relationship patterns
- **Deduplicate entities**: "NYC" and "New York City" are stored as different strings
- **Contextual retrieval**: Asking about "my work" should surface Google + Project Aurora + colleagues — but embedding similarity may miss the structural connection

`MemoryItemTag` provides rudimentary grouping but not entity-relation modeling.

### Evidence

| Source | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Mem0 `graph_memory.py` | `MemoryGraph` with entity extraction via LLM tool calling, 26% accuracy improvement with graph-augmented retrieval |
| Mem0 entity dedup | `_search_source_node()` / `_search_destination_node()` using embedding similarity threshold |
| Research Report C2 | Knowledge graph + vector hybrid retrieval rated "Critical" |
| Repo Analysis #1, #2 | SQLite-backed knowledge graph and graph+vector hybrid retrieval both rated "Critical" |

### User Impact

- "Tell me about my family" → fails to connect Alice (sister), Mom (parent), Bob (brother-in-law)
- "What's happening at work?" → surfaces "User works at Google" but misses "Project Aurora" and "colleague Sarah mentioned in last week's conversation"
- User mentions "New York City" and later "NYC" → stored as unrelated facts, no entity linking

---

## 3. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

1. Two new SQLite tables (`kg_entities`, `kg_relations`) for entity-relationship storage
2. LLM-based entity and relation extraction via structured tool calling during consolidation
3. Entity deduplication via normalized names and embedding similarity
4. Graph traversal via SQL JOINs (max depth 2) for contextual retrieval
5. `knowledge_graph` memory block injected into the system prompt with relevant entity relationships
6. Graph ingestion runs in background consolidation pipeline, invisible to user
7. Keep the graph SQLite-backed inside the Core, preserving portability, encryption, and single-directory ownership

### Non-Goals

- **Neo4j, Kuzu, Memgraph, and similar graph backends/platform abstractions** — competitor implementations inform lifecycle patterns only; AnimaOS remains SQLite-backed inside the Core
- **Deep graph traversal** (depth > 2) — unnecessary for personal-scale graphs
- **Automatic entity resolution against external knowledge bases** — no Wikipedia, Wikidata, etc.
- **Graph visualization UI** — backend only in this PRD
- **Replacing vector search** — the graph augments it, does not replace it
- **Importing graph-platform abstractions** — no Cypher, graph services, graph daemons, or backend-specific admin workflows
- **World model synthesis** — the knowledge graph provides raw entities and relations; a higher-level "world model" narrative synthesis is a separate feature

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Data Model

**Table: `kg_entities`**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|

**Indices**: `ix_kg_relations_source` on `(source_id)`, `ix_kg_relations_dest` on `(destination_id)`

### 4.2 Entity Extraction via LLM Tool Calling

Following Mem0's pattern, entity extraction uses structured tool calls:

```python
EXTRACT_ENTITIES_TOOL = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "extract_entities",
        "description": "Extract entities mentioned in the conversation",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "entities": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "name": {"type": "string"},
                            "type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["person", "place", "organization", "project", "concept"]},
                            "description": {"type": "string"}
                        },
                        "required": ["name", "type"]
                    },
                    "maxItems": 5
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

EXTRACT_RELATIONS_TOOL = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "extract_relations",
        "description": "Extract relationships between entities",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "relations": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "source": {"type": "string"},
                            "relation": {"type": "string"},
                            "destination": {"type": "string"}
                        },
                        "required": ["source", "relation", "destination"]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

    ...
```

### 4.5 Graph Traversal Implementation

Since we're using SQLite (not Neo4j), graph traversal uses SQL JOINs:

**Depth 1** (direct relations):
```sql
SELECT e2.name, r.relation_type, e2.entity_type
FROM kg_relations r
JOIN kg_entities e2 ON r.destination_id = e2.id
WHERE r.source_id = :entity_id AND r.user_id = :user_id
UNION
SELECT e2.name, r.relation_type, e2.entity_type
FROM kg_relations r
JOIN kg_entities e2 ON r.source_id = e2.id
WHERE r.destination_id = :entity_id AND r.user_id = :user_id
```

**Depth 2**: Run depth-1 query, collect result entity IDs, run depth-1 again from those IDs. Two queries, not a recursive CTE — simpler and predictable performance.

For < 1,000 entities (typical for a personal AI), this completes in < 50ms.

### 4.6 Graph Lifecycle

The graph is **not append-only**. F4 adopts a bounded lifecycle that keeps the graph local and SQLite-native while preventing monotonic accumulation of stale relations.

**Lifecycle policy**

1. During `ingest_conversation_graph()`, extract entities and relations from the current turn.
2. Upsert entities first, then load only existing relations that touch the entities mentioned in the new turn.
3. Run `prune_stale_relations()` against that bounded candidate set before finalizing the turn's graph state.
4. Delete only relations the pruning step classifies as outdated or contradicted by evidence in the new turn.

This means stale-relation pruning happens **during ingestion only**, against relations touching the current turn's entities. F4 does not include a sleep-time pruning pass, a whole-graph cleanup sweep, or any separate graph-maintenance subsystem. Competitor systems using Neo4j, Kuzu, or Memgraph are relevant here only as evidence that append-only graphs drift; they do not change AnimaOS's storage architecture.

### 4.7 Graph Retrieval and Reranking Policy

F4 explicitly **adopts lightweight reranking** for graph results. After `search_graph()` returns a small traversal set (max 20 triples), `rerank_graph_results()` BM25-reranks those triples against the user query before `graph_context_for_query()` builds the `knowledge_graph` block.

The rationale is straightforward:

- SQL traversal is good at finding connected triples, not ordering them by query phrasing.
- The candidate set is already small, so in-process BM25 reranking is cheap and predictable.
- AnimaOS does **not** add an external reranker service or graph-specific search backend for this; lightweight local reranking is enough.

### 4.8 Modified Files

| File | Function | Change |
|------|----------|--------|
| `consolidation.py` | `run_background_memory_consolidation()` | After memory consolidation, call `ingest_conversation_graph()` |
| `memory_blocks.py` | `build_runtime_memory_blocks()` | Add `knowledge_graph` block between `relationships` and `current_focus`. Call `graph_context_for_query()`. |
| `models/agent_runtime.py` | (module level) | Add `KGEntity` and `KGRelation` model classes |
| `models/__init__.py` | exports | Export `KGEntity`, `KGRelation` |

### 4.9 Memory Block Format

The `knowledge_graph` block in the system prompt:

```
## Knowledge Graph (relationships between entities in User's life)

- Alice (person, User's sister) → lives_in → Munich
- Alice (person) → birthday → March 15
- Google (organization) → employer_of → User
- Project Aurora (project) → related_to → Google
- Sarah (person, colleague) → works_at → Google
```

Estimated size: 200-400 tokens for 10-15 triples. Omitted when no relevant graph context is found for the current query.

### 4.10 Entity Type Taxonomy

| Type | Examples | When extracted |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `person` | Alice, Sarah, Dr. Smith | Names of people mentioned in conversation |
| `place` | Berlin, Munich, "the coffee shop on Main St" | Locations mentioned |
| `organization` | Google, MIT, "Alice's school" | Companies, institutions |
| `project` | Project Aurora, "my thesis", "the kitchen renovation" | Named efforts or initiatives |
| `concept` | Python, machine learning, stoicism | Technical terms, interests, philosophies |

### 4.11 Relation Type Conventions

Freeform strings, but the LLM prompt encourages consistent naming:

```
works_at, lives_in, sister_of, brother_of, parent_of, married_to,
friend_of, colleague_of, related_to_project, interested_in,
member_of, located_in, part_of, created_by
```

| F4.2 | `KGRelation` model with all columns from Section 4.1 | Must |
| F4.3 | `extract_entities_and_relations()` using LLM structured tool calls | Must |
| F4.4 | `normalize_entity_name()` for consistent dedup keys | Must |
| F4.5 | `upsert_entity()` with normalized-name dedup and `mentions` increment | Must |
| F4.6 | `upsert_relation()` with source/destination entity lookup and `mentions` increment | Must |
| F4.7 | `deduplicate_entity()` via embedding similarity (threshold 0.85) for alias resolution | Should |
| F4.8 | `search_graph()` traversing with max_depth=2, limit=20 | Must |
| F4.9 | `graph_context_for_query()` extracting entity names from query and returning context strings | Must |
| F4.10 | `ingest_conversation_graph()` full pipeline called during background consolidation | Must |
| F4.11 | `knowledge_graph` memory block added to `build_runtime_memory_blocks()` | Must |

| F4.15 | Full vault export/import support for `kg_entities` and `kg_relations` | Must |
| F4.16 | `rerank_graph_results()` — BM25 reranking of graph traversal results before returning context; lightweight local reranking is required for the max-20 triple candidate set | Must |
| F4.17 | `prune_stale_relations()` — LLM-driven deletion of outdated/contradicted relations during ingestion (adopted from Mem0) | Must |
| F4.18 | UUID/ID hallucination protection — map real entity/relation IDs to sequential integers before sending to LLM prompts, map back after; use ID indirection only inside LLM-facing pruning flows, not as a new storage layer (adopted from Mem0) | Must |
| F4.19 | Tool-calling fallback — when the LLM does not support `function_call` / tool use, fall back to a JSON-formatted prompt with response parsing (consistent with existing codebase patterns in consolidation.py, episodes.py) | Must |
| F4.20 | Storage architecture constraint — the knowledge graph remains SQLite-backed inside the Core; Neo4j, Kuzu, Memgraph, and similar systems are reference material only, not implementation targets | Must |

    op.create_index("ix_kg_relations_source", "kg_relations", ["source_id"])
    op.create_index("ix_kg_relations_dest", "kg_relations", ["destination_id"])
```

- New tables: **2** (`kg_entities`, `kg_relations`)
- New indices: **3**

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Entity extraction quality** | Medium | Structured tool calling (function_call) with explicit schema. 5-entity cap prevents garbage floods. Entity dedup catches duplicates. |
| **Graph explosion** | Medium | 5-entity cap per turn. `mentions` increment on existing entities rather than creating new ones. Aggressive normalization + embedding dedup. |
| **SQLite graph traversal performance** | Low | Depth capped at 2, result limit 20. For < 1,000 entities, this is fast. No recursive CTEs — just two sequential queries. |
| **Architecture drift from competitor patterns** | Medium | Mem0 and similar systems inform pruning and ID-indirection safeguards only. F4 explicitly rejects Neo4j, Kuzu, Memgraph, and related platform abstractions to preserve the portable Core. |
| **LLM tool calling compatibility** | Medium | Not all models via Ollama/OpenRouter support structured tool calling. Fallback: use a regular prompt with JSON output format + parsing. |
| **Entity type drift** | Low | Fixed enum in tool schema. LLM may occasionally choose wrong type, but this is cosmetic — graph traversal doesn't filter by type. |
| **Relation type inconsistency** | Low | LLM may use "works_at" vs "employed_at" vs "works_for" for the same relation. Normalize common variations in `upsert_relation()`. |
| **Stale relation accumulation** | Medium | Without pruning, the graph grows monotonically and outdated relations compete with current ones. Mitigated by ingestion-time pruning scoped to relations touching the current turn's entities via `prune_stale_relations()` (F4.17), adopted from Mem0's pattern but kept bounded for SQLite/Core constraints. |
| **LLM ID hallucination** | Medium | LLMs may hallucinate or corrupt entity/relation IDs when they appear in prompts. Mitigated by mapping real IDs to sequential integers before LLM calls (F4.18), adopted from Mem0's pattern. |

## 11. Knowledge Graph vs World Model

The inner-life thesis (Section 2.6) describes a "world model" as a structured section of user memory: key people, places, recurring situations, active projects. The knowledge graph provides the **storage and traversal layer** for this concept:

- `kg_entities` stores the key people, places, and projects
- `kg_relations` stores how they connect
- `graph_context_for_query()` is the retrieval interface

A higher-level "world model narrative" — a synthesized prose summary of the user's life context generated from graph data — is a separate future feature that would consume the knowledge graph as input. This PRD covers the graph infrastructure, not the narrative synthesis.
